We wrote a sanity check file which uses pytest and checks basic invariants, LABS energy invariances, CPU batch energy == scalar energy == (optional) GPU batch energy, MTS never worsens best energy (convergence sanity), Physical bounds: 0 <= E <= sum_{k=1}^{N-1} (N-k)^2. The file can be found at test_phase_ab_sanity.py. This file was run locally, as were most other post-processing files and is hence not a jupyter notebook. We chose these particular tests to maximize coverage of the highest-risk parts of the pipeline (energy correctness, symmetry properties, and GPU/CPU parity), so that a single run of the suite catches both subtle numerical bugs and workflow bugs without requiring expensive large-N experiments.
To be clear, the file can be found at test_phase_ab_sanity.py.
