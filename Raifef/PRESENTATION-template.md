Your team must produce a cohesive story of your project.

* **If In-Person:** A live 5-10 minute presentation to the judges.
* **If Remote:** A 5-10 minute voice-over slide deck (MP4 format) included in your github repository.

**Example Presentation Agenda:**

1. The Plan & The Pivot:

* Briefly outline your original strategy from the PRD. Did you stick to the plan? If you had to change your algorithm or acceleration strategy mid-stream, explain why. Engineering is about adaptation; tell us about the obstacles you overcame.

2. Results: 

* Present your results based on the Success Metrics defined in your PRD. For example, use charts to visualize your Time-to-Solution and Approximation Ratio compared to the baseline.

3. The Retrospective:

* Conclude with a personal touch. Each team member should share one specific technical or strategic takeaway from the challenge (e.g., "I learned that moving data to GPU is slower than computing on CPU if the batch size is too small").
